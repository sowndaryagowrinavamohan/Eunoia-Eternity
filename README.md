# Eunoia-Eternity
# Drought Prediction Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting drought conditions using machine learning techniques. It leverages historical weather data, soil moisture levels, and other relevant features to forecast the likelihood of drought in a given region.

## Features

- Historical weather data analysis
- Soil moisture level monitoring
- Machine learning model for drought prediction
- Web-based visualization of prediction results

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for data exploration and model development)

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Data Preparation:

Download historical weather data.
Obtain soil moisture level datasets.
Preprocess the data using provided scripts (data_preprocessing.py).
Model Training:

Use Jupyter Notebook/ Google collab/ VS code  (model_training.ipynb) for experimenting with different machine learning models.
Train the selected model using the training dataset.
Prediction:

Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
View predictions through the web-based visualization (web_visualization/index.html).
